export const explanation = 'Periodization is a training method that involves planned cycles of training and rest to optimize performance and prevent overtraining or injury. It aims to help individuals gradually increase their strength and reach their one rep max, or the maximum amount of weight they can push, pull, or press for one repetition. Periodization involves dividing training into specific periods or phases, each with a different focus or goal, and systematically progressing through these phases over time.'
